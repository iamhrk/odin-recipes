    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani reached Hyderabad with the invading army of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the late 1600s, and the chefs for Nizam (the monarchy of Hyderabad) developed 47 new varieties for royal consumption. The vegetarian version is called Tahiri biryani. The quintessential Hyderabadi biryani cooks raw goat meat and rice together until the meat flavors seep into the rice. Fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves add flavor, but it&#39;s the strong spices and sourness that define Hyderabadi biryani. </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Grind black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, star anise and 
    cumin seeds into a fine powder. Finely chop mint and coriander leaves.</li>
    <li>Add dry spice mix, chopped mint and coriander leaves and other 
    marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl and combine all of them.

    and add bay leaves, chillies, and stir for about 1-2 minutes. 
    Remove a tbsp of ghee from the pot and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken along with the marinade into the pot and 
    cook for 2 minutes per side until it&#39;s no longer pink. 
    Spread the drained rice on top, sprinkle fried onions and 
    drizzle ghee with saffron milk on top. 
    Cook for 8-10 minutes over a high flame covered with a lid. 
    Then reduce the flame to low and continue cooking for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn off the flame and let it stand covered for about 15 minutes.

    green salad.</li>
