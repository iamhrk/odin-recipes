    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The crown king of all biryanis, Lucknowi biryani was created in Northern India by Mughal royals in Awadh around the 18th century, when culinary finesse rose to its peak in the royal kitchens. The rice is cooked separately in spices, and marinated chicken is added later in a separate layer and cooked in a vessel over a low flame in dum pukht style (meaning in a pot sealed with flour) for hours. Delicate whole spices like saffron and star anise play the role of showcasing, rather than overpowering, the rich flavors of the meat. The subtle fragrance stays on as an after-effect</p>
